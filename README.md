# Scout4Artists
Helping record labels, music publishers and producers to discover artists.

The goal of "Scout 4 Artists" is to provide music industry professionals including A&R, publishers and producers a tool to discover up and coming artists; based on specific selection criteria e.g. similar artists with similar popularity.

### What is the real-world problem "Scout4Artists" is trying to solve?
As a music producer, I am always on the lookout for the next "collaboration" with an artist who's music I both enjoy but who's career is on the right trajectory to make it beneficial for both myself and the artist
- It is very easy to find artists who in their **early stages**. The internet and your local music venue is full of these hard working aspiring singers and songwriters
- It is also very easy to find **absolutely huge mega-stars**, who's tracks you hear on the radio every day. In a dream world you would just reach out to Coldplay and they would say "yeah I'd love to work with you"; but unfortunately we live in the real world, and even worse, we are talking about the deep dark depths of the music industry!

**In comes "Scout4Artists" to save the day** (and to save you time!). Simply select a few key criteria and voilla, a list of artists you may be a perfect match for will appear! Criteria includes (but will not be limited to):
- Genre e.g. Pop / Rock / EDM etc..
- Similar artists e.g. Green Day, Justin Bieber, Sam Smith etc..
- Similar songs e.g. Basket Case, What Do You Mean, Stay With Me
- Popularity Index. **This is extremely useful**, and is marked from 0 to 100 in Spotify (0 = not very popular, 100 = extremely popular e.g. Ed Sheeran). For example, I may be searching for someone with popularity of "30" (as this will bring back artists who are likely to respond when I reach out to them, but also popular enough to make the collaboration beneficial to both parties).

As I noted on the User Journey diagram, this is not limited to just music producers. Publishers, record label A&R's and even other artists may use this as a tool to scout for artists too :)

## How to build the code
Development has not yet started, but I will let you know how to build it once it gets going! Until then you can see the development backlog within the [projects](https://github.com/users/lorenzopoulloura/projects/3) section of this repository
